      <description>How many people do you need in a room before there is a 50% chance that least two of them share the same birthday? It&amp;rsquo;s only 23, though unless you have heard about this paradox before, you might expect it to be much larger. This is the well-known birthday paradox: it&amp;rsquo;s called a paradox only because collisions happen much faster than one naively expects. Collisions here means an event where two or more observed values are equal.</description>
