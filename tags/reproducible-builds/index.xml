      <title>Tracking which wheels can be reproducibly built</title>

      <description>Being able to reproducibly build binary artifacts means that users, developers, and others can agree that the shipped artifact was correctly built from the source code (that one can inspect), and no intentional or unintentional malicious code was introduced during the build process.
One hiccup we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered in SecureDrop development is that not all Python wheels can be built reproducibly. We ship multiple (Python) projects in debian packages, with Python dependencies included in those packages as wheels.</description>
