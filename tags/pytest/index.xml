      <title>A pytest fixture for image similarity</title>

      <description>When testing codepaths that generate images, one might want to ensure that the generated image is what is expected. Matplotlib has a nice decorator @image_comparison that can be applied for this purpose, but looking at the implementation, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty tied to the matplotlib Figure object. I wanted something generic to use with PNGs.
I ended up writing a pytest fixture that would compare the image generated during the test with a baseline image (in tests/baseline_images as in the matplotlib implementatino).</description>

      <title>Strategies for handling flaky test suites</title>

      <description>Test flakes are tests that occasionally fail due to a variety of potential reasons including network instability (for tests making network calls that are not mocked) and other non-deterministic behavior. Test flakes are problematic as they reduce confidence in the results of test runs: they condition developers that the test suite cannot be relied on, and as such can result in legitimate bugs being ignored due to alert fatigue.</description>
