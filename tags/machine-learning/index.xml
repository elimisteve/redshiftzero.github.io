      <description>This is a writeup of a talk that I gave at Defcon 23&amp;rsquo;s Cryptography and Privacy Village back in August 2015. The presentation included a brief primer on machine learning as some in the audience were unfamiliar with the topic, so skip down to &amp;ldquo;Is there really a problem here?&amp;rdquo; if you are already familiar with ML. Thanks to all who attended and for the excellent questions and comments! References are embedded as links in the text.</description>
