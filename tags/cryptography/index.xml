      <title>Investigating the Signal Protocol, Part 1: Foundations</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been investigating applications that use the Signal Protocol in order to determine if the Signal Protocol for asynchronous messaging might be appropriate for use for applying to SecureDrop messaging in the future. In this post are some notes from reading the Signal Protocol specifications, which I thought might be a useful reference and explanation for others. If you notice an error, or have other thoughts on anything here, feel free to drop me a note on Twitter or by email.</description>

      <title>Implementing the CBC padding oracle attack</title>

      <description>The CBC padding oracle attack demonstrates how what might initially seem like a small issue can balloon into a devastating attack that can result in total reconstruction of the plaintext by the attacker. It&amp;rsquo;s also one of the harder challenges in Set 3 of Cryptopals.
The problem It goes like this: an attacker has access to an oracle that will take a ciphertext (i.e. what we need to decrypt) and return a boolean indicating whether or not the padding was valid.</description>

      <title>Collision attacks and the birthday paradox</title>

      <description>How many people do you need in a room before there is a 50% chance that least two of them share the same birthday? It&amp;rsquo;s only 23, though unless you have heard about this paradox before, you might expect it to be much larger. This is the well-known birthday paradox: it&amp;rsquo;s called a paradox only because collisions happen much faster than one naively expects. Collisions here means an event where two or more observed values are equal.</description>
