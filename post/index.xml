      <title>Implementing the CBC padding oracle attack</title>
      <link>https://redshiftzero.github.io/cbc-padding/</link>

      <description>The CBC padding oracle attack demonstrates how what might initially seem like a small issue can balloon into a devastating attack that can result in total reconstruction of the plaintext by the attacker. It&amp;rsquo;s also one of the harder challenges in Set 3 of Cryptopals.
The problem It goes like this: an attacker has access to an oracle that will take a ciphertext (i.e. what we need to decrypt) and return a boolean indicating whether or not the padding was valid.</description>

      <title>Using pyreverse to generate UML class diagrams</title>
      <link>https://redshiftzero.github.io/pyreverse-uml/</link>

      <description>Recently I wanted to generate UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams of the structure of an existing codebase for the purpose of having an architecture discussion.
I was wondering if there was a tool to generate UML diagrams in Python to save me some manual work.
Enter pyreverse: it comes installed with pylint which is a very common development dependency in Python. pyreverse enables you to point to the code you want UML diagrams of, here in my example I was generating a diagram of a project called securedrop-export:</description>

      <title>Debugging programs with pdb</title>

      <description>I recently decided to try my hand at making YouTube videos. I&amp;rsquo;m planning on mostly making videos about topics I commonly find myself explaining to people, so here&amp;rsquo;s the first, on using pdb, the built-in debugger in the Python standard library.

      <title>Strategies for handling flaky test suites</title>
      <link>https://redshiftzero.github.io/test-flakes/</link>

      <guid>https://redshiftzero.github.io/test-flakes/</guid>
      <description>Test flakes are tests that occasionally fail due to a variety of potential reasons including network instability (for tests making network calls that are not mocked) and other non-deterministic behavior. Test flakes are problematic as they reduce confidence in the results of test runs: they condition developers that the test suite cannot be relied on, and as such can result in legitimate bugs being ignored due to alert fatigue.</description>

      <title>Collision attacks and the birthday paradox</title>
      <link>https://redshiftzero.github.io/birthday-attacks/</link>

      <description>How many people do you need in a room before there is a 50% chance that least two of them share the same birthday? It&amp;rsquo;s only 23, though unless you have heard about this paradox before, you might expect it to be much larger. This is the well-known birthday paradox: it&amp;rsquo;s called a paradox only because collisions happen much faster than one naively expects. Collisions here means an event where two or more observed values are equal.</description>

      <title>Why Publishing Data on ICE Employees is in the Public Interest</title>
      <link>https://redshiftzero.github.io/publishing-public-interest/</link>

      <description>This was written with Camille Fassett and first appeared on the website of the Lucy Parsons Labs.
Motivated by the Trump administrationâ€™s policy of detaining and separating migrant children from their families at the border, artist and developer Sam Lavigne harvested profiles that list Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as an employer on social network LinkedIn.
He made the dataset of all 1595 responsive profiles, which included names, titles, photographs and general locations, available to download on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Cosmological Power Spectra with d3.js</title>
      <link>https://redshiftzero.github.io/visualizing-cosmological-power-spectra/</link>

      <description>Cosmologists make observations of galaxies and radiation in the universe to constrain parameters of the Lambda CDM model , which is the model that best describes our current understanding of the universe. These cosmological parameters include quantities like &amp;Omega;m and &amp;Omega;&amp;Lambda;, which describe the matter and dark energy content of the universe respectively.
Two key observables that constrain these parameters are the matter power spectrum and the angular power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.</description>

      <title>How SecureDrop Works 101</title>
      <link>https://redshiftzero.github.io/securedrop-101/</link>

      <description>When people first learn of the SecureDrop architecture, it can seem quite complicated. When explaining SecureDrop to people for the first time, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to have a cartoon view providing a broad overview before digging into further technical details (in my experience this is true of any sufficiently technical concept/system). After noticing this confusion from users, I made this quick one-minute video to distill the most important points for the source and journalist workflows:</description>

      <title>Inside the Chicago Police Department&#39;s Secret Budget</title>
      <link>https://redshiftzero.github.io/cpd-asset-forfeiture/</link>

      <description>Every year, police take millions of dollars from Chicagoans through civil asset forfeiture and spend it behind closed doors. In collaboration with Muckrock, my co-authors and I did an independent financial audit of this previously undocumented part of the police budget. We demonstrated these asset forfeiture funds are used to circumvent city council oversight and finance controversial surveillance devices. This investigation appeared as a front page feature in the September 29, 2016 issue of the Chicago Reader.</description>

      <title>Primer on Police Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://redshiftzero.github.io/police-surveillance-primer/</link>

      <description>I wrote a short primer describing and visualizing police surveillance technology. This project was also posted on the website of the Lucy Parsons Labs.

Cameras, automatic license plate readers, cell site simulators and many other surveillance devices are currently used in the city by the Chicago Police Department and its sister agencies. However, many citizens are unaware of the scope of the surveillance systems, their huge cost, and the privacy implications of their use.</description>
