      <title>Getting started in Rust and WebAssembly</title>

      <description>In my last post I described how I implemented the signal-protocol Python library, which provides Python bindings using Pyo3 to an upstream maintained Rust cryptography crate implementing the Signal protocol. I created the the signal-protocol library in order to prototype end-to-end encrypted messaging between journalists and their sources through SecureDrop. In the SecureDrop ecosystem, journalists use a Python project, securedrop-client, hence the need for the Python bindings, and sources use Tor Browser.</description>

      <title>Creating Python extensions in Rust using PyO3</title>

      <description>This post describes how I approached writing a Python extension in Rust. The post covers:
 why one would even want to do this üôÉ the approaches for calling Rust code from Python an overview of how to create a Python module in Rust using PyO3 some tricky parts, e.g. inheritance building and distributing wheels  Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
First, why do this at all? There are two main reasons:</description>

      <title>Continuous threat modeling, Part 1: Tooling wish list</title>
      <link>https://www.redshiftzero.com/continuous-threat-modeling/</link>

      <description>Motivation When performing software-centric threat-modeling on an application1, one typically:
 generates at least one Data Flow Diagram (DFD) or other diagrams that model the software, enumerates threats using the diagram(s) as an aid, and then determines which mitigations should be applied.  Automated tools can potentially aid the threat modeler in each of these stages. When the design of a system is modified, the threat modeling exercise may be performed again, resulting in needing to pass through the above steps again.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Signal Protocol, Part 3: Web applications</title>

      <description>Next in the series, I investigate current messaging applications that both provide web applications and are using the Signal Protocol (or a protocol very similar or derived from Signal), here specifically Wire and Whatsapp. I&amp;rsquo;m not looking into the voice and video aspects, just the messaging and file sharing capabilities as I&amp;rsquo;m investigating to see how a similar approach could be used for SecureDrop, where voice/video isn&amp;rsquo;t an option. As always, if you have thoughts on this or notice errors, feel free to drop me a note on Twitter or by email.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Signal Protocol, Part 2: Groups, devices</title>

      <description>Next in the series, I investigate how groups and multi-device support are handled. If you have thoughts on this or notice any errors, feel free to drop me a note on Twitter or by email.
Groups Signal allows private groups where the server doesn&amp;rsquo;t have access to the group metadata, including the list of members in each group. Servers cannot even distinguish group from direct messages.
Let&amp;rsquo;s say a group contains two users, Aliceüëßüèº and Bobüë¶üèΩ, and a third user Jenüßô wants to send the group a message.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Signal Protocol, Part 1: Foundations</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been investigating applications that use the Signal Protocol in order to determine if the Signal Protocol for asynchronous messaging might be appropriate for use for applying to SecureDrop messaging in the future. In this post are some notes from reading the Signal Protocol specifications, which I thought might be a useful reference and explanation for others. If you notice an error, or have other thoughts on anything here, feel free to drop me a note on Twitter or by email.</description>

      <title>Scanning for onion service availability</title>

      <description>Secure The News (STN) is a project by Freedom of the Press Foundation to track and advocate for security and privacy technologies in news organizations. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working a bit on expanding the scope of STN from its original goal, HTTPS adoption, to how news sites treat Tor users.
The first expansion is to scan for onion service availability using the the Onion-Location header (or its presence in a &amp;lt;meta&amp;gt; tag in the site&amp;rsquo;s page content).</description>

      <title>Tracking which wheels can be reproducibly built</title>
      <link>https://www.redshiftzero.com/reproducible-wheels/</link>

      <description>Being able to reproducibly build binary artifacts means that users, developers, and others can agree that the shipped artifact was correctly built from the source code (that one can inspect), and no intentional or unintentional malicious code was introduced during the build process.
One hiccup we&amp;rsquo;ve encountered in SecureDrop development is that not all Python wheels can be built reproducibly. We ship multiple (Python) projects in debian packages, with Python dependencies included in those packages as wheels.</description>

      <title>Protecting journalists from malware using QubesOS</title>

      <description>Earlier this year at USENIX Enigma, I presented some recent work towards rearchitecting the SecureDrop journalist experience.
In SecureDrop we currently use an airgapped workstation for viewing documents to reduce the impact of malware present in malicious documents. This presents challenges in terms of maintenance, usability, and even security (i.e. airgaps don&amp;rsquo;t receive automatic updates).
The basic idea of the rearchitecture of the journalist experience is to replace SecureDrop&amp;rsquo;s multi-machine airgap with a single machine using Qubes (Xen) for compartmentalization.</description>

      <title>Using HTTPS Everywhere rules for SecureDrop onion names</title>

      <description>A fun small project I worked on earlier this year was creating an HTTPS Everywhere custom ruleset channel for the SecureDrop project. HTTPS Everywhere is a popular browser extension maintained by EFF that rewrites HTTP URLs to HTTPS when possible. A set of rules is used to determine how URLs should be rewritten. HTTPS Everywhere is included in Tor Browser to reduce the impact of malicious exit nodes.
This is relevant for SecureDrop, because each news organization advertises an onion URL that corresponds to the web application (&amp;ldquo;source interface&amp;rdquo;) where a source should upload documents.</description>
