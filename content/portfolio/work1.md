Monitoring police officers using public and crowdsourced data.
<!--more-->OpenOversight is an interactive web tool and accountability platform that makes it easier for the public to identify police officers, including for the purpose of complaints. We rely on crowdsourced and public data to build a database of police officers in a city.

Using OpenOversight, members of the public can search for the names and badge numbers of police with whom they have negative interactions using the officer's estimated age, race and gender. Using this information, the OpenOversight web application returns a digital gallery of potential matches and, when possible, includes pictures of officers in uniform to assist in identification.
