SecureDrop is an anonymous whistleblowing platform for news organizations.
<!--more-->
SecureDrop provides a Tor onion service for anonymous sources to use to send files and/or messages to journalists at news organizations. It is currently widely deployed in dozens of news organizations, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Associated Press, the USA Today, and more. Deployments install SecureDrop on-prem on physical hardware. You can see the full list in the [SecureDrop Directory](https://securedrop.org/directory).

See how it works in this [short YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkgN244ggzs).
