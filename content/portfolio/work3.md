This is a data-driven Early Intervention System (EIS) for police departments. The system uses a police department's officer-level data to predict which officers are likely to have an adverse interaction with the public using historical data and machine learning.

The current code is on GitHub [here](https://github.com/dssg/police-eis). I was involved with this project as a postdoc from 2015 to 2016. It is currently deployed in Charlotte-Mecklenberg Police Department (see: [wsoctv media coverage](https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/charlotte-mecklenburg-police-using-technology-to-analyze-officers/719415686)). For more, see the KDD 2016 paper "Identifying Police Officers at Risk of Adverse Events" [here](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/adf0832-cartonAemb.pdf)
(PDF).
