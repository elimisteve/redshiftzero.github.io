# Projects

#### SecureDrop

SecureDrop is an anonymous whistleblowing platform for journalistic sources to use to send files and messages to news organizations. It is currently widely deployed in dozens of news organizations, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Associated Press, the USA Today, and more. You can see the full list of deployments in the [SecureDrop Directory](https://securedrop.org/directory). See how it works in this [short YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkgN244ggzs).

Code: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop)

Role: Maintainer (2016-present), lead developer (2017-present)

#### OpenOversight

OpenOversight is an interactive web tool and accountability platform that makes it easier for the public to identify police officers, including for the purpose of complaints. It relies on crowdsourced and public data to build a database of police officers in a city.
Using OpenOversight, members of the public can search for the names and badge numbers of police with whom they have negative interactions using the officer's estimated age, race and gender. Using this information, the OpenOversight web application returns a digital gallery of potential matches and, when possible, includes pictures of officers in uniform to assist in identification. It is currently deployed on the Chicago, Oakland, Berkeley, and University of California Berkeley Police Departments.

Role: Began project (2016), primary developer (2016-present)

#### Predicting Police Misconduct

This project is a data-driven Early Intervention System (EIS) for police departments. The system predicts which officers are at the highest risk of an adverse interaction with the public using machine learning models trained on officer-level historical data from the department. It is currently deployed in Charlotte-Mecklenberg Police Department.

Role: Primary data scientist while a postdoc (Sept 2015- Sept 2016), technical mentor to two teams of Data Science for Social Good fellows working on the models (Summer 2016)

#### Predicting Building Code Issues

As part of the Data Science for Social Good Fellowship in 2015, my team and I built  a machine learning model that [predicted](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/project/proactive-blight-reduction-and-neighborhood-revitalization/) which properties in the city of Cincinnati were likely to have building code violations, used for allocating limited city resources.
